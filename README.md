# About
 Toy pseudorandom number generator, based on LFSR algorithm using rdtsc like source of entropy.
 It generates both 32 and 64 bit unsigned integers.
 Also i've added range method for normalizing numbers, after that i think this code has chance to be used in real projects! (but i don't know for what, but it can)
